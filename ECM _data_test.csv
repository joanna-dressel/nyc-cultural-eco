1013243,HVAC_Controls_and_Sensors,Install TRVs,"Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) are temperature responsive valves that replace the manual on/off valves currently installed on apartment PTAC units and base board radiators.  TRVs automatically regulate the heating water flow to the radiators and PTAC units based on actual space conditions.  As the space heats up, the TRV will close, reducing water flow to the terminal unit.  As the space cools down, the TRV will open, allowing water flow to the terminal unit.  This thermostatic control reduces space overheating and reduces overall heating energy consumption.   TRVs are adjustable such that space temperatures can be generally controlled by the space occupant.  Replace all terminal unit on/off valves with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs).  TRVs with remote control units are recommended to better enable occupant control.    "

Conversion to Natural Gas as the main fuel source for boiler operations will result in significant energy cost savings due to the low cost of Natural Gas as compared to Fuel Oil.  Conversion to Natural Gas will also result in higher overall system efficiency, greatly reduced boiler emissions and reduced maintenance costs. It is recommended that ownership replace the natural gas meter to begin burning Natural gas again via the low pressure steam boilers after resolution of the gas metering issue that is causing over billing by Conedison. There is no implementation cost to this measure due to the fact that all of the infistructure to operate the boiler on gas is already in place. Cost savings shown are based on historical average rates the building pays for natural gas covering accounts that were not affected by the metering issue that impacted the meter covering the main heating system for this building."

1009706,Motors,Install VFDs,"The heating and condenser water closed loop system is currently a constant flow system that operates continuously to supply heat pump units throughout the building. Demand for conditioned heating and cooling water varies greatly based on the loads and occupancy of the building.  During unoccupied hours and sholder seasons, most units will be bypassing water flow.  Although there is minimal need for heating and condenser water during these times, this type of system means that the pump is still circulating water at full speed.  This situation results in wasted pump energy during periods of low demand. Variable flow water systems vary the pump speed in response to actual demand.  In these systems, bypass valves are replaced with 2-way (on/off) valves as needed and a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is used to control the pump speed.  As air heating and fancoil units shut off and the 2-way valves close, pressure within the circulating system increases.  The VFD responds to this pressure increase by slowing the pump motor.  This reduction in motor speed provides significant energy savings. Install VFDs on the closed loop water pump to optimize pump speed based on actual load conditions.

TRVs automatically regulate the heating water flow to the radiators based on actual space conditions.  As the space heats up, the TRV will close, reducing water flow to the terminal unit.  As the space cools down, the TRV will open, allowing water flow to the terminal unit.  This thermostatic control reduces space overheating and reduces overall heating energy consumption.   TRVs are adjustable such that space temperatures can be generally controlled by the space occupant. Replace all terminal unit on/off valves with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs).  TRVs with remote control units are recommended to better enable occupant control."

1038550,Motors,Install VFDs,"The heating and chilled water closed loop system is currently a constant flow system that operates continuously to supply  water to air handling and fan coil units throughout the building. Demand for heating and cooling water varies greatly based on the loads and occupancy of the building.  During unoccupied hours and sholder seasons, most units will be bypassing water flow.  Although there is minimal need for heating and chilled water during these times, this type of system means that the pump is still circulating water at full speed.  This situation results in wasted pump energy during periods of low demand. Variable flow water systems vary the pump speed in response to actual demand.  In these systems, bypass valves are replaced with 2-way (on/off) valves as needed and a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is used to control the pump speed.  As air heating and fancoil units shut off and the 2-way valves close, pressure within the circulating system increases.  The VFD responds to this pressure increase by slowing the pump motor.  This reduction in motor speed provides significant energy savings. Install VFDs on the closed loop water pump to optimize pump speed based on actual load conditions.  Pump motors will need to be replaced with premium efficiency models as required for VFD compatibility."

However, there is no need to run all three (3) pumps simultaneously during during periods of low demand. The continuous circulation of heating hot water during these times is an unnecessary use of energy.  Having pump relays cycle the heating hot water pumps in sequence rather than in parallel will save energy and should have no negative impact on building operations. Install pump relays on the heating hot water pumps to cycle the pumps in sequence rather than simultanouesly to improve the overall efficiency of the distribution system by reducing the wear on the pumps during each heating season.  This will reduce annual run time to approximately for each pump to roughly 2,920 hrs/yr. (perhaps less) while avoiding negative impact on building operations."

However, based on building occupancy, there is no need to maintain domestic hot water temperature 24/7 as opposed to demand based. The continuous circulation of hot water during times of low demand is an unnecessary use of energy.  Installing an aquastat to more properly regulate domestic hot water based off of demand will save energy and should have no negative impact on building operations. Install an aquastat on the domestic hot water circulator to automatically shut the circulator pump off during times of low demand when the pump is between the high and low cutoffs established by the aquastat. This will reduce annual run time to approximately 5000 hrs./yr. while avoiding negative impact on building operations."

These motors are standard efficiency motors that are past their useful life (15+ years).  Premium efficiency/ECM motors currently available would decrease the electricity used for providing outside air to common areas. Retrofit the larger corridor supply system fan motor with a NEMA premium efficiency motor. For this motor, premium efficiency motor converts more power input into useful work compared to a standard efficiency motor of this age. Retrofit existing fan motors on the smaller corridor supply system and basement boiler room supply system with ECM motors. ECM motors are significantly more efficient compared to standard efficiency motors and operate at significantly lower temperatures. Additionally, these motors have extended motor life and are lower maintenance costs than the existing traditional induction motors."

1085975,Motors,Install VFDs,"The heating closed loop system is currently a constant flow system that operates continuously to supply  water to air handling and fan coil units throughout the building. Demand for heating water varies greatly based on the loads and occupancy of the building.  During unoccupied hours and shoulder seasons, most units will be bypassing water flow.  Although there is minimal need for heating and chilled water during these times, this type of system means that the pump is still circulating water at full speed.  This situation results in wasted pump energy during periods of low demand. Variable flow water systems vary the pump speed in response to actual demand.  In these systems, bypass valves are replaced with 2-way (on/off) valves as needed and a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is used to control the pump speed.  As air heating and fan coil units shut off and the 2-way valves close, pressure within the circulating system increases.  The VFD responds to this pressure increase by slowing the pump motor.  This reduction in motor speed provides significant energy savings. Install VFDs on the each of the closed loop water pumps servicing heating zones 1 through 3 to optimize pump speed based on actual load conditions.  Any 3-way bypass valves must also be replaced with 2-way on/off valves on all air handling and fan coil units serviced by the closed water loop."

This system is relatively inefficient as compared to dedicated DHW equipment and may result in unnecessary utilization of the steam to domestic hot water heat exchanger to satisfy DHW loads when steam heating is not also necessary (e.g. during shoulder seasons). Install a dedicated Natural Gas fired fully condensing Domestic Hot Water boiler.  Fully condensing DHW boilers have efficiencies approaching 98% as compared to 80% for the district steam system (DHW heat exchanger).  In addition, this dedicated unit will eliminate any unnecessary utilization of the steam system to satisfy domestic hot water needs. The implementation cost for this measure includes boiler installation, natural gas infrastructure required, and DHW piping required. The cost does not include the installation of a vent chimney liner. "

TRVs automatically regulate the heating water flow to the radiators based on actual space conditions.  As the space heats up, the TRV will close, reducing water flow to the terminal unit.  As the space cools down, the TRV will open, allowing water flow to the terminal unit.  This thermostatic control reduces space overheating and reduces overall heating energy consumption.   TRVs are adjustable such that space temperatures can be generally controlled by the space occupant. Replace all terminal unit on/off valves with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs).  TRVs with remote control units are recommended to better enable occupant control."

1043866,Motors,Install VFDs,"The heating and chilled water closed loop system is currently a constant flow system that operates continuously to supply  water to air handling and fan coil units throughout the building. Additionally, the condenser water loop supplying water to the cooling tower is also a constant flow system that operates continuously. Demand for heating and cooling water varies greatly based on the loads and occupancy of the building.  During unoccupied hours and shoulder seasons, most units will be bypassing water flow.  Although there is minimal need for heating and chilled water, and therefore condenser water, during these times, this type of system means that the pump is still circulating water at full speed.  This situation results in wasted pump energy during periods of low demand. Variable flow water systems vary the pump speed in response to actual demand.  In these systems, bypass valves are replaced with 2-way (on/off) valves as needed and a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is used to control the pump speed.  As air heating and fan coil units shut off and the 2-way valves close, pressure within the circulating system increases.  The VFD responds to this pressure increase by slowing the pump motor.  This reduction in motor speed provides significant energy savings. Install VFDs on the dual temperature and condenser pumps to optimize pump speed based on actual load conditions.  Any 3-way bypass valves must also be replaced with 2-way on/off valves on all air handling and fan coil units serviced by the closed water loop."

1056646,Ventilation,Other,"During the heating season, Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs) installed in front of outdoor air intakes pre-temper cold outdoor air via heat transfer from warmer exhaust air.  During the cooling season, this effect is reversed as hot outdoor air is pre-tempered via heat transfer to cooler exhaust air. This pre-tempering of intake air reduces the overall load on building heating and/or cooling systems that are responsible for conditioning the intake air.  ERVs may be selected that do not mix exhaust air and intake air in any manner, thereby eliminating any concern over odors or contamination of intake air. The rooftop packaged unit serving common area hallways is in close proximity to several exhaust fans and therefore a good candidate for installation of an ERV unit.  As the rooftop unit is used for both heating and cooling, installation of an ERV will effectively lower overall building heating and cooling costs. Duct exhaust air from the rooftop exhausts to an ERV.  The ERV will then provide pre-tempered outdoor air to the rooftop packaged unit.  The size of the ERV must be properly matched to the intake air requirements of the rooftop unit.  One or more exhaust flows may be connected to the ERV up to the maximum capacity of the ERV.  Increasing the amount of exhaust air captured will increase overall efficiency gains and result in greater energy savings.       "

1076627,HVAC_Controls_and_Sensors,Install TRVs,"Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) are temperature responsive valves that replace the manual on/off valves currently installed on apartment base board radiators.  TRVs automatically regulate the heating water flow to the radiators based on actual space conditions.  As the space heats up, the TRV will close, reducing water flow to the terminal unit.  As the space cools down, the TRV will open, allowing water flow to the terminal unit.  This thermostatic control reduces space overheating and reduces overall heating energy consumption.   TRVs are adjustable such that space temperatures can be generally controlled by the space occupant. Replace all terminal unit on/off valves with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs).  TRVs with remote control units are recommended to better enable occupant control.    "

TRVs automatically regulate the heating steam flow to the radiators based on actual space conditions.  As the space heats up, the TRV will close, reducing steam flow to the terminal unit.  As the space cools down, the TRV will open, allowing steam flow to the terminal unit.  This thermostatic control reduces space overheating and reduces overall heating energy consumption.   TRVs are adjustable such that space temperatures can be generally controlled by the space occupant.  Replace all terminal unit on/off valves with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs).  TRVs with remote control units are recommended to better enable occupant control.    "

Replacement of the less efficient lighting types with higher efficiency LED lighting options will provide immediate energy savings and reduced operating costs.  Fixture by fixture lighting retrofit recommendations are included in the appendix of this report.  Lamp replacement can often be performed by in house building staff.  Third party contractors may be necessary for full fixture replacement. However, capital replacement of these lights are not recommended at this time due to high implementation cost and long simple payback period. The extended payback period of this measure is largly due to the amount of solar production at this site."
